a. What are some pros/cons of Agile development?

    Pros: 
        - Lower cost to late-stage changes. AGILE uses continuous testing and incremental development so bugs and design issues 
        are discovered early and dealt with. This makes fixes smaller and cheaper compared to traditional SWE dev models where
        problems are often not found until the later stages of development - requiring major reworking.
        - Continuous testing of a working product. Each AGILE sprint delivers a testable, working version of the final product,
        allowing a SWE team to validate all functionality throughout the development stages rather than waiting until the final
        stages. 
    
    Cons: 
        - Harder to predict a final cost and timeline. AGILE allows for ongoing changes based on incremental testing and feedback,
        which in some cases makes it quite difficult to give a timeline and cost estimate in the early stages as we simply wouldn't
        know the problems and reworkings that need to happen before the final product is delivered. 
        - Harder to diagram and document throughout. With AGILE and its associated changing stories, tasks, etc, diagrams and 
        documentation can change frequently, which then need to be updated after each SPRINT.
